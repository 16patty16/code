# LET'S MAKE MONDAY (or rather any day) EXCITING!

In this repository we are sharing all code that has been presented during the breakout session BRKSDN-2379 at Cisco Live Europe 2020 in Barcelona. The main goal with these scripts is to introduce Network Engineers to the power and possibilities of programmability by providing some simple examples. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. Python installed in your development environment. 
2. An active virtual environment where you have installed the required modules and libraries.
3. An IOS XE device for testing against

Follow this lab to create your developer environment: <https://developer.cisco.com/learning/modules/dev-setup/dev-win/step/1>

 
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
